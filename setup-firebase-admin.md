# Firebase Admin SDK Setup Guide

## Issue
The authentication system requires Firebase Admin SDK to be properly configured with environment variables.

## Solution
You need to create a `.env.local` file in the `ai_mock_interviews` directory with your Firebase Admin SDK credentials.

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Get Firebase Admin SDK Credentials
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `interview-prewise`
3. Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon)
4. Click on **Service Accounts** tab
5. Click **Generate New Private Key**
6. Download the JSON file

### 2. Create .env.local file
Create a file named `.env.local` in the `ai_mock_interviews` directory with the following content:

```env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=interview-prewise
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@interview-prewise.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

Replace the values with the actual values from your downloaded JSON file:
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Use `interview-prewise`
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`: Copy from the JSON file's `client_email` field
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Copy from the JSON file's `private_key` field (keep the quotes and newlines)

### 3. Restart your development server
After creating the `.env.local` file, restart your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What was fixed:
1. ✅ Added missing return statement in `signIn` function
2. ✅ Improved error handling in authentication flow
3. ✅ Added better error messages for missing environment variables
4. ✅ Fixed `isAuthenticated` function to properly return boolean values

## Testing:
After setting up the environment variables, try:
1. Creating a new account (sign up)
2. Signing in with the created account
3. The authentication should now work properly

If you still encounter issues, check the browser console and server logs for specific error messages.
